## Goals

* Compare typeface glyphs
* Compare relative widths of typefaces
* See type set in and against specific colors

## FAQ

### Why did you make this?
I needed a fast way to compare glyphs between typefaces.

### Why are colors' opacity set to 0.996?
It's a hack to make sure the inverse text selection background is not overwritten by Chrome defaults.
At an opacity of 1, Chrome applies it's own more opaque value, but a customer value of 255/266 works.

## Your random color generator made an unreadable combination.
That mean's it's working! "Safe" color generators often end up producing very samey palettes.
You just might find your new favorite combination, have fun with it!
